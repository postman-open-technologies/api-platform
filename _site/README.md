# API Lifecycle
This is a project to see how we can define the API lifecycle in a modular and flexible enough way that anyone can define their own version of the API lifecycle using a common set of elements and actions. This runs on Github, and everything is defined using YAML, allowing it to be forked and worked on collaboratively, using Github issues to evolve and iterate upon the repository of API lifecycle blueprints, elements, and actions.

The objective of this work to provide living blueprints that can help introduce developers to a well-defined API lifecycle from a variety of entry points, reflective a variety of priorities. Providing a base to think about the API lifecycle, but also provide many different other elements and actions that can be taken to help enterprise organizations better establish a known and well defined API lifecycle.

## Participation
This project depends on the feedback of API producers and consumers to help better define each of the blueprints, as well as the elements, actions, links, and other properties they possess. With more discussion and feedback we will keep iterating on the content and artifacts available here. Using Github, Jekyll, issues, discussions, and other parts of this project to move forward how we define, discuss, and realize the API lifecycle across our organizations.
